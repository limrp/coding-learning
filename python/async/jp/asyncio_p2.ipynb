    "Yes, asyncio provides a method to create a task for a brand new event loop that hasn't started yet. This can be done using the `loop.create_task()` method, where `loop` is an instance of a new event loop. Here's how you can create a new event loop and schedule a task on it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a New Event Loop**: First, you create a new event loop using `asyncio.new_event_loop()`.\n",
    "2. **Set the New Loop as the Current Loop**: You then set this new loop as the current event loop for the thread using `asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)`.\n",
    "3. **Create a Task on the New Loop**: After setting the new loop, you can create a task on it using `loop.create_task(coroutine)`.\n",
    "4. **Run the Loop**: Finally, you start the loop with `loop.run_until_complete(task)` or `loop.run_forever()`, depending on your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define an asynchronous function (coroutine)\n",
    "async def simulated_task():\n",
    "    print(\"Task: Performing a task...\")\n",
    "    await asyncio.sleep(1)\n",
    "    print(\"Task: Task completed.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new event loop\n",
    "new_loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set the new loop as the current loop\n",
    "asyncio.set_event_loop(new_loop)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a task on the new loop\n",
    "task = new_loop.create_task(simulated_task())\n",

    "new_loop.run_until_complete(task)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the loop\n",
    "new_loop.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a brand new event loop is created and used to run the `simulated_task` coroutine. This is a common pattern when you need to run asynchronous code in environments where an event loop is not already running, such as in some scripts or non-async contexts."

    "## P3. Differences Between `asyncio.new_event_loop()` and `asyncio.run(main())`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Usage Context**:\n",
    "   - `asyncio.new_event_loop()`: This approach is typically used in environments where you need more control over the event loop lifecycle or when you're integrating with existing applications that may have their own event loop management. It allows for manual setup and teardown of the event loop.\n",
    "   - `asyncio.run(main())`: This is a high-level API for running a coroutine and managing the event loop. It's a simpler and more straightforward way to run async code, ideal for scripts or standalone async applications. It automatically creates a new event loop, runs the given coroutine, and closes the loop at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Event Loop Management**:\n",
    "   - With `asyncio.new_event_loop()`, you have to manually create the loop, set it as the current loop, and ensure it's properly closed. This gives you more flexibility but also requires more boilerplate code.\n",
    "   - `asyncio.run(main())` handles all these steps for you. It creates the loop, runs the coroutine, and closes the loop, all in one call. This makes the code cleaner and reduces the risk of errors like forgetting to close the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility and Control**:\n",
    "   - Using `asyncio.new_event_loop()` gives you more control over when and how the event loop is run and closed. This can be important in complex applications where you need to integrate with other event-driven code.\n",
    "   - `asyncio.run(main())` is more opinionated and straightforward, providing a standard way to run async code without needing to manage the event loop details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a non-Jupyter environment, if you're writing a simple script or a standalone async application, `asyncio.run(main())` is usually the preferred and easier method. However, if you need more control over the event loop or are integrating with other frameworks, manually managing the event loop with `asyncio.new_event_loop()` might be necessary."

    "Certainly! Let's consider a bioinformatics scenario where you might have multiple long-running, I/O-bound tasks, such as querying different genomic databases or running computations on large datasets.

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Asynchronous Functions**: `fetch_variant_data` and `fetch_gene_expression` simulate the asynchronous fetching of data. They use `await asyncio.sleep()` to mimic network delay.\n",
    "- **Callbacks**: The `process_data` function is a callback that processes the data once it's fetched. It's attached to each task and is called once the task completes.\n",
    "- **Concurrency**: The `asyncio.gather()` function waits for both tasks to complete, allowing them to run concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-Life Application:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real-world scenario, you would replace the simulated fetching functions with actual asynchronous HTTP requests to the respective databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "The callback function could be more complex, involving data parsing, analysis, or integration with other data sources.\n",
    "\n",

    "Here's a breakdown of the issue and how to resolve it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Issue:** \n",
    "   - The warning `RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'main' was never awaited` indicates that the coroutine `main()` was scheduled to run as a task (`loop.create_task(main())`), but it was never actually awaited or run to completion. \n",
    "   - This happens because after creating the task, you didn't start the loop with `loop.run_until_complete(main())` or `loop.run_forever()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Solution:** \n",
    "   - In the `except` block, where you handle the `RuntimeError`, you should ensure that the event loop runs the `main()` coroutine to completion.\n",
    "   - This can be achieved by replacing `loop.create_task(main())` with `loop.run_until_complete(main())`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the corrected portion of the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    loop.run_until_complete(main())\n",
    "except RuntimeError:\n",
    "    # If the loop is closed, you need to reopen it\n",

    "    loop.run_until_complete(main())  # Run the main coroutine to completion\n",
    "```\n",

    "Is this because, in the except block, a new event loop was created and `loop.create_task(main())` is not enough to ensure that the event loop runs the `main() `coroutine to completion and that's why it needs to be replaced by `loop.run_until_complete(main())`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, your understanding is correct. Let's break it down for clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In the `except` Block**:\n",
    "   - When a new event loop is created using `asyncio.new_event_loop()`, **it is not running by default**. This is a fresh event loop, independent of any that might be running in the background (like the one in a Jupyter Notebook).\n",
    "   - Therefore, after creating and setting this new event loop, **you need to explicitly start it to run your coroutine**. This is where `loop.run_until_complete(main())` comes into play. It starts the new event loop and runs the `main()` coroutine to completion.\n",
    "   - If you were to use `loop.create_task(main())` in this context without starting the loop (i.e., without `loop.run_until_complete(main())` or `loop.run_forever()`), the coroutine would be scheduled but would not execute because the loop isn't running."

    "The error message you're encountering indicates a common issue when working with event loops in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Let's break down the error and the changes you made to the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In the `try` Block**:\n",
    "   - You have `loop.run_until_complete(main())`, but in a Jupyter Notebook, the event loop is typically already running. This is why you get the `RuntimeError: This event loop is already running`. In such an environment, `loop.run_until_complete(main())` is not appropriate because it tries to start an already running loop.\n",

    "2. **In the `except` Block**:\n",
    "   - You correctly create a new event loop and set it as the current loop. However, the issue arises with these two lines:\n",
    "     - `loop.create_task(main())`\n",
    "     - `loop.run_until_complete(main())`\n",
    "   - The problem is that you're essentially scheduling the `main()` coroutine twice: first with `create_task`, and then again with `run_until_complete`. This is unnecessary and leads to the warning about a coroutine that was never awaited.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Corrected Script**:\n",
    "   - To correct the script, you should schedule the `main()` coroutine only once in the `except` block. Either use `create_task` and then start the loop with something like `loop.run_forever()`, or use `run_until_complete` directly.\n",

    "     ```python\n",
    "     # ... [rest of your code] ...\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Instead of using asyncio.run, use the existing event loop\n",

    "You've made a very important observation. In a Jupyter Notebook environment, there is indeed already an event loop running, and this context makes the behavior of asyncio slightly different than in a standard Python script. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **New Event Loop**: When you create a new event loop using `asyncio.new_event_loop()`, it is indeed a different loop from the one that Jupyter Notebook is already running. However, in the Jupyter environment, you typically don't need to create a new loop unless the default loop is closed or not suitable for some reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using `loop.create_task(main())`**: In the Jupyter Notebook, since an event loop is already running, using `loop.create_task(main())` schedules the `main()` coroutine on the existing event loop. This approach works **because the running event loop will pick up and execute the task you've scheduled**. This is why your `try` block works correctly and all the output is generated as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Run to Completion**: When you schedule a task on an existing event loop, as you did with `loop.create_task(main())`, the event loop continues to run and will execute this task. You don't need to manually start the loop again because it's already running.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Behavior in Jupyter vs. Standard Python Script**: The key difference in a Jupyter Notebook environment is that you don't typically start and stop the event loop manually, as the notebook's underlying infrastructure is already handling an event loop. This contrasts with a standalone Python script, where you have more control over when and how the event loop starts and stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, your understanding and adaptation of the asyncio code to work within the Jupyter Notebook environment is correct. \n",

    "   - The existing running event loop will pick up and execute the task you’ve scheduled. You don’t need to manually start the loop with `loop.run_until_complete(main())` or `loop.run_forever()` because the loop is already active and handling tasks.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - In a typical Python script, you have full control over the event loop: creating it, starting it, running tasks, and stopping it. \n",

    "The error message you're encountering indicates a common issue when working with event loops in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Let's break down the error and the changes you made to the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In the `try` Block**:\n",
    "   - You have `loop.run_until_complete(main())`, but in a Jupyter Notebook, the event loop is typically already running. This is why you get the `RuntimeError: This event loop is already running`. In such an environment, `loop.run_until_complete(main())` is not appropriate because it tries to start an already running loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **In the `except` Block**:\n",
    "   - You correctly create a new event loop and set it as the current loop. However, the issue arises with these two lines:\n",
    "     - `loop.create_task(main())`\n",
    "     - `loop.run_until_complete(main())`\n",
    "   - The problem is that you're essentially scheduling the `main()` coroutine twice: first with `create_task`, and then again with `run_until_complete`. This is unnecessary and leads to the warning about a coroutine that was never awaited.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Corrected Script**:\n",
    "   - To correct the script, you should schedule the `main()` coroutine only once in the `except` block. Either use `create_task` and then start the loop with something like `loop.run_forever()`, or use `run_until_complete` directly.\n",
    "   - Here is a revised version of the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # ... [rest of your code] ...\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Instead of using asyncio.run, use the existing event loop\n",
    "     loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n",
    "\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         print(\"try block\")\n",
    "         # In a Jupyter environment, this line should be commented out or removed\n",
    "         # loop.run_until_complete(main()) # cannot be called on a loop that's already running\n",
    "         loop.create_task(main())\n",
    "         print(\"end of try block\")\n",
    "     except RuntimeError:\n",
    "         print(\"Except block\")\n",
    "         # If the loop is closed, you need to reopen it\n",
    "         loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()\n",
    "         asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)\n",
    "         loop.run_until_complete(main())  # Correct way to run the coroutine on the new loop\n",
    "         print(\"End of except block\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Summary**:\n",
    "   - In a Jupyter Notebook, use `loop.create_task(main())` without `run_until_complete` in the `try` block.\n",
    "   - In the `except` block, where you're dealing with a fresh event loop, use `loop.run_until_complete(main())` to run the coroutine to completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach should avoid the errors and warnings you've encountered and allow your asyncio code to run smoothly in a Jupyter Notebook environment."
